        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install flask-redis
        
        Or if you *must* use easy_install:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            alias easy_install="pip install $1"
            easy_install flask-redis
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Your configuration should be declared within your Flask config. You can declare
        via a Redis URL containing the database
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            REDIS_URL = "redis://:password@localhost:6379/0"
        
        
        To create the redis instance within your application
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
            redis_store = FlaskRedis(app)
        
        or
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis
        
            redis_store = FlaskRedis()
        
            def create_app():
                app = Flask(__name__)
                redis_store.init_app(app)
                return app
        
        or perhaps you want to use ``StrictRedis``
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis
            from redis import StrictRedis
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
            redis_store = FlaskRedis.from_custom_provider(StrictRedis, app)
        
        or maybe you want to use
        `mockredis <https://github.com/locationlabs/mockredis>`_ to make your unit
        tests simpler.  As of ``mockredis`` 2.9.0.10, it does not have the ``from_url()``
        classmethod that ``FlaskRedis`` depends on, so we wrap it and add our own.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis
            from mockredis import MockRedis
        
        
        
            class MockRedisWrapper(MockRedis):
                '''A wrapper to add the `from_url` classmethod'''
                @classmethod
                def from_url(cls, *args, **kwargs):
                    return cls()
        
            def create_app():
                app = Flask(__name__)
                if app.testing:
                    redis_store = FlaskRedis.from_custom_provider(MockRedisWrapper)
                else:
                    redis_store = FlaskRedis()
                redis_store.init_app(app)
                return app
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``FlaskRedis`` proxies attribute access to an underlying Redis connection. So treat it as if it were a regular ``Redis`` instance.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from core import redis_store
        
            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                return redis_store.get('potato', 'Not Set')
        
        **Protip:** The `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ package currently holds the 'redis' namespace,
        so if you are looking to make use of it, your Redis object shouldn't be named 'redis'.
        
        For detailed instructions regarding the usage of the client, check the `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ documentation.
        
        Advanced features, such as Lua scripting, pipelines and callbacks are detailed within the projects README.

        History
        =======
        
        0.1.0 (4/15/2015)
        -----------------
        
        - **Deprecation:** Renamed ``flask_redis.Redis`` to ``flask_redis.FlaskRedis``.
          Using the old name still works, but emits a deprecation warning, as it will
          be removed from the next version
        - **Deprecation:** Setting a ``REDIS_DATABASE`` (or equivalent) now emits a
          depracation warning as it will be removed in the version in favor of
          including the database number in ``REDIS_URL`` (or equivalent)
        - Added a ``FlaskRedis.from_custom_provider(provider)`` class method for using
          any redis provider class that supports instantiation with a ``from_url``
          class method
        - Added a ``strict`` parameter to ``FlaskRedis`` which expects a boolean value
          and allows choosing between using ``redis.StrictRedis`` and ``redis.Redis``
          as the defualt provider.
        - Made ``FlaskRedis`` register as a Flask extension through Flask's extension
          API
        - Rewrote test suite in py.test
        - Got rid of the hacky attribute copying mechanism in favor of using the
          ``__getattr__`` magic method to pass calls to the underlying client
